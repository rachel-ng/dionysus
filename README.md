# flask_starter

a super basic flask starter kit made based off my work from my [softdev2 final project](https://github.com/tfabiha/ccereal/)

### it uses: 
- python3 
- [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) (w. flashing!)
- [jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) (for templating)
- [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- sqlite (dbs)

## to do: 
- [ ] make a requirements.txt
- [ ] "instructions"
