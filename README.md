a super basic flask starter kit made based off my work from my [softdev2 final project](https://github.com/tfabiha/ccereal/)


## How to Use



## How to Run



## Dependencies

Install the dependencies with [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) by running the following command

```
(venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- python3 
- [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) (w. flashing!)
- [jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) (for templating)
- [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- sqlite (dbs)


## to do
- [x] make a requirements.txt
- [ ] "instructions"
