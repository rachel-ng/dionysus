# dionysus

a super basic flask starter kit made based off work from my [softdev2 final project (catatonic cereal)](https://github.com/tfabiha/ccereal/) and the [readme](https://github.com/rachel-ng/group-d-etat) from my [softdev1 final project (ambrosia)](https://github.com/rachel-ng/group-d-etat)  

I finally updated it again after abandoning it for approximately 2 years and idk how much more I'll be doing  
but it's unlikely anyone but me is reading this ðŸ¤ª

## Features 

<!-- For a list of in progress<sup>*(ish)*</sup> features, [refer to this](#to-do) -->

- python3, html, css, etc. 
- [semi decent readme](#sample.md) to base stuff off of  
- [.gitignore](.gitignore) (it's also a [gist](https://gist.github.com/rachel-ng/7e26de56cb4a6370164213bd33c31f54))
- [flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)
    - [flash](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/patterns/flashing/) `categories`  
      e.g. `flash("Error: Invalid Location", category="location")`  
      <sub>Refer to [lines 62-86](https://github.com/rachel-ng/dionysus/blob/master/templates/base.html#L62-L86) of [base.html](templates/base.html) for more details on implementation</sub>
- [jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) (for templating)
- [sqlite](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/sqlite3.html) (DBs, for python functions see [config.py](util/config.py) and [db.py](util/db.py))  
    [config.py](util/config.py) uses `os` for absolute paths  
    <sup>so it doesn't go to *absolute hell* when you try to make it compatible with apache or something</sup>  
- accounts
    - stored in [data.db](data/data.db)
    - [db.py](util/db.py): functions for account creation and authentication
    - login, signup, logout (via sessions, POST)
    - password hashing (via `passlib`, uses `sha256_crypt`)
- [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)  
- custom css and js  
    <sup>js file is empty btw</sup>   
    <sup>also idk if i ever actually tested this oops</sup>   
    <sup>but theoretically it should work</sup>   
    ```
    static/css/base.css
    
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='css/base.css') }}">
    ```
    ```
    static/js/my.js
    
    <script src="{{ url_for('static', filename='js/my.js') }}"></script>
    ```


## Usage

attain the files somehow (fork, download, clone repo and move files, idk it's up to you) and alter them to your choosing

### Important Files

For a full list of features, refer to [the above](#the-good-)

- `util/config.py` contains functions for configuring your database  
    you may choose to change the [directory](https://github.com/rachel-ng/dionysus/blob/master/util/config.py#L8) your database is in ( `data/` ) and/or the [db file's name](https://github.com/rachel-ng/dionysus/blob/master/util/config.py#L9) ( `data/data.db` )
- `util/db.py` contains functions for account creation and authentication
- `templates/base.html` the og jinja base html


### requirements.txt

<sup>THESE ARE INSTRUCTIONS FOR IF YOU'RE MAKING ONE</sup>

0. PRE-REQ: You need to be in your virtual environment (venv).  
<sup>Follow the [instructions here](sample.md#dependencies) if you don't have a virtual environment</sup>

1. In the root of your repo, run this: 

    ```
    (venv) $ pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```
    
    This takes a "snapshot" of all your python packages and versions installed within your virtual environment and lists them in your [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) and allows users to run your program on their own computer without worrying about compatibility issues. 
    
2. You can now use your requirements.txt by running the following command: 
    ```
    (venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
